# 65 + Sunny

This app tells you where you go camping that has forecasted the weather you're looking for

## Getting Started

To clone locally, naviagate to your preferred directory, then:

```
git clone git@github.com:stuart-gill/sunny65.git
```

### Prerequisites

If you want to access the database as it is being build or updated, I recommend DB Browser for SQLite. Download here:

```
https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/
```

Also, make sure you have numpy installed and accessible for Python 3

```
https://numpy.org/
```

### Installing

If you want to rebuild the database file (sunny65_db.sqlite), run in command line:

```
$python3 sunny65_db.py
```

When it prompts you if you want to build databases, type 'y' and hit enter

To run the main program, run in command line:

```
$python3 sunny65.py
```

Once your locations are found, you can check the map of campsites that's been built:

```
$open where.html
```
